# Starting with an empty queue, implemented as a linked list, perform the following sequence of operations:

# enqueue('Z')
# enqueue('A')
# enqueue('B')
# enqueue('X')
# dequeue()
# enqueue('Y')
# enqueue('Z')
# enqueue('W')
# dequeue()
# dequeue()
# For your answer, create a drawing of the final state of the linked list.
